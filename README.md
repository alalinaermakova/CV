# Alina Ermakova

As a Junior Full Stack Software Developer, I am deeply passionate about weaving creativity into my code. My journey through Makers has honed my ability to rapidly learn and apply new skills, a testament to my adaptability in fast-paced environments. This time involved pair programming and collaborative problem-solving, where I effectively leveraged my strong communication skills to streamline development processes.
My proficiency in Test-Driven Development demonstrates my methodical approach to coding, ensuring that I write comprehensive test cases for software reliability. Additionally, my debugging skills have been crucial in error identification and resolution, further solidifying my technical expertise.
Yandex Practicum was pivotal in laying a solid foundation in web application development. The practice-oriented bootcamp improved my proficiency in key technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Webpack. My regular engagement in project code reviews on GitHub and use of Figma for design work show my commitment to continuous learning and collaboration.
I am enthusiastic about agile methodologies and thrive in teams that present challenges and opportunities for growth.
